# python-challenge

I worked with a tutor to start my PyBank code. I was also having issues with my file path and had some help fixing it. 

When I better understood the assignment, I was able to complete the code with the help of ChatGPT. I basically used the same code outline I used for PyBank for PyPoll. 

I referenced:

per my tutor's instructions to understand how to append my lists.
